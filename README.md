Welcome to my webapp, Beta Vzn ("beta vision")!

'Beta': the way in which a climber solves a boulder problem

This app will allow the targeted user audience (rock climbers) to search for boulder problems/routes based on location and grade/difficulty.
The user can add additional search filters, including minimum grade/difficulty, maximum grade/difficulty, and number of results to display.
The app will return a list of boulder problems, diplaying for a single result:
    -Name of the boulder problem/route
    -Grade/difficulty
    -Location
    -Mountain Project link
    -Embedded YouTube videos

This app will grab data from 3 sources:
    -Google Maps Geocoding API **** need to change this due to Google Maps Geocoding requiring billing
    -Mountain Project Data API
    -YouTube Data API
