# Beta Vzn
Welcome to my webapp, Beta Vzn ("beta vision")!

[Link to Live Project](https://cjoy-ant.github.io/beta-vzn/)

'Beta': the solution, or movements, that a climber uses to solve and finish a boulder problem.

This app will allow the targeted user audience (rock climbers) to search for boulder problems/routes based on location and grade/difficulty. The user can add additional search filters, including minimum grade/difficulty, maximum grade/difficulty, and number of results to display.

The app will return a list of boulder problems, diplaying for a single result:
    -Name of the boulder problem/route
    -Grade/difficulty
    -Location
    -Mountain Project link
    -Embedded YouTube videos

This app will grab data from 3 sources:
    -MapQuest Forward Geocoding API
    -Mountain Project Data API
    -YouTube Data API

Technology used:
    -HTML
    -CSS
    -Javascript
    -jQuery
