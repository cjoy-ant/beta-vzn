# BetaVzn
Welcome to my webapp, [BetaVzn](https://cjoy-ant.github.io/beta-vzn/) ("beta vision")

#### 'Beta': the solution, or movements, that a climber uses to solve and finish a boulder problem.

BetaVzn will allow the targeted user audience (rock climbers) to search for boulder problems/routes based on location and grade/difficulty. The user can add additional search filters, including minimum grade/difficulty, maximum grade/difficulty, and number of results to display. The feature that makes this app unique is its consolidation of Mountain Project information and relevant YouTube videos.

The app will return a list of boulder problems and display the following information for a single result:
* Name of the boulder problem/route
* Grade/difficulty
* Link to Mountain Project page
* Embedded YouTube videos
